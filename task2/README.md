# Task 2

- Second task for Ant Colony technical interview

### Task description

- Write a function that takes an object and a string, which represents an object lookup path, for
  example "property1.property2".
  The function should return the value on the specific path.
- Take care of error handling.
- Example:
- - function lookup(obj, path){....}
- - object = { property1: { property2: "Apple", property3: 'Orange' } }
- - path = ”'property1.property2'”
- - lookup(object, path)) Result: 'Apple'

### How to start algorithm

- run "npm install"
- run "npm start" to run tests and check example from task descriptions
- run "npm test" to run tests for this algorithm, first one is same example from description, second one is different just to be sure

### File names and dependecies

#### Files

- index.js - main file containing algorithm
- test.js - main file for tests

#### Dependencies
