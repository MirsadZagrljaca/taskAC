### Task for Ant Colony -- Fullstack Task

#### Task description

- Build REST API using a technology you feel most comfortable at that should support
  handling business operations of a car wash facility and create frontend to utilize and
  consume the API, we recommend you use React.js.
  The car wash facility should be able to:
- Create a customer
- Customers can be billed in different ways, depending on their loyalty, so for example
  each 10th run will have an additional discount.
- The facility can have multiple washing programs.
- Each program consists of steps and these steps should be able to be combined into a
  washing program
- We need to track all the activities
  You are free to extend the functionality, so the solution handles more business cases
  that you see fit. The solution should be covered with tests and use best practices for
  making the code extensible

#### App info

I've built this app using MERN stack (MongoDb,Express js, Node js and React js), it follows REST Api protocol.

- I've decided to build app that will help car wash buissnesses track their's customers, programs for washing cars and services they provided to thoose customers.
- It consist of 3 parts:
- - first is Customers: Two routes on frontend and full CRUD on backend, First One being table with customers with paging, second one being adding new customers,
- - second is Programs: For adding and looking at a washing program
- - third one being Services: Once you take order from customer you make new service consisting of that customer and program he wants app calculates discount for you, every tenth service is 10% off
- Sidebar is form of navigation on app, just follow it to explore all features
- Naming should be pretty self explanatory, as well as routes on both backend and frontend.

#### To start it you should

- cd client && npm install && npm start && open browser on http://localhost:3000/
- cd server && npm install && npm start

#### Thank you for considering me.

#### Enjoy!
